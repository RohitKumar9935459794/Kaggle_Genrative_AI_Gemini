You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

He woke with the sunrise, patrolled the perimeter of the garden, enjoyed a breakfast of tuna and kibble, and then napped until lunchtime. His days were predictable, almost boring. That is, until the day a small, brightly colored bird landed on the fence.\n\nThis bird was unlike any Bartholomew had ever seen. Its feathers shimmered turquoise and gold, and its song was a tinkling melody. Intrigued, Bartholomew stalked closer. The bird, unfazed, chirped and hopped along the fence, its tiny beady eyes twinkling with mischief.\n\n\"Hello, little bird,\" Bartholomew purred, his voice rumbling like thunder. \"What's your name?\"\n\nThe bird tilted its head, its tiny beak twitching. \"I am Pip,\" it chirped, \"and I come from a land beyond the garden, a place where the sun never sets and the flowers bloom forever.\"\n\nBartholomew’s whiskers twitched. This sounded far more interesting than his usual naps.\n\n\"Tell me more,\" he said, his tail swishing back and forth in excitement.\n\nPip chirped, describing a land of waterfalls and meadows, filled with sweet-smelling flowers and exotic creatures. Bartholomew listened, mesmerized. He had never been beyond the garden, never seen anything beyond his usual routine. Pip’s tales of adventure sparked a fire within him.\n\n\"I want to see this land,\" Bartholomew declared, his green eyes gleaming with newfound ambition.\n\nPip chirped excitedly. \"Come with me, then!\"\n\nWith Pip perched on his back, Bartholomew set off on his adventure. They crossed the garden, leaping over the fence and into the unknown. The world beyond was vast and different, filled with unfamiliar sounds and scents. They met a family of squirrels who shared their acorns, a wise old owl who told stories of the moon, and a mischievous rabbit who challenged Bartholomew to a race.\n\nThe days passed in a blur of excitement. Bartholomew felt a thrill he hadn’t experienced in years. He learned about the world outside his garden, and the beauty of the unknown. He even learned to sing, mimicking Pip’s melodic chirps.\n\nFinally, after weeks of adventure, Bartholomew reached the land of never-setting sun. Pip had been right. It was even more beautiful than he could have imagined.\n\nBut as he stood on the edge of this fantastical land, Bartholomew felt a pang of longing. He missed his warm bed, his familiar routine, and the scent of his tuna and kibble. It was time to go home.\n\nHe bid farewell to Pip, promising to return soon, and set off on the journey back. He carried the memories of his adventure in his heart, a reminder that even the most ordinary cat could find extraordinary experiences if he dared to venture beyond his comfort zone.\n\nBack in his familiar garden, Bartholomew felt a sense of peace he hadn’t felt before. He still enjoyed his naps and his tuna, but now he knew there was a whole world out there waiting for him to explore. And he knew, with a purr of contentment, that he would return to the land of never-setting sun, someday soon. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.

Barnaby would sit patiently by his bowl, his eyes glued to Agnes's every movement, his tail thumping a steady rhythm against the floor. The moment Agnes placed the bowl down, Barnaby would inhale the food with the ferocity of a starving wolf. \n\nOne day, a storm raged outside, howling like a banshee. The power went out, plunging Agnes's house into darkness. Barnaby, usually a creature of habit, panicked. No light, no bowl, no Agnes. He whined, his ears drooping. Agnes, her face lit by the flickering glow of a candle, noticed his distress. She reached into her bag and produced a small, crinkly package. \n\n“Don’t worry, Barnaby,” she whispered, opening the package. “This is for emergencies.”\n\nIt was a bag of treats, the kind Barnaby only got on special occasions. Agnes, with a smile, tossed him one. Barnaby caught it in mid-air, his tail wagging furiously. In that moment, the storm seemed less menacing, the darkness less frightening. \n\nAs Barnaby munched on the treat, Agnes realized that food wasn't just sustenance for Barnaby. It was a symbol of love, a reassurance of her presence, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, he wasn't alone.

Here's a breakdown of its purpose and why you'd use it:\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* **Provides Git-aware prompt:** This script modifies your shell's prompt (what you see before typing a command) to include details about the current Git repository.\n* **Customizable:** You can configure the prompt's appearance, including colors, symbols, and what information is displayed (e.g., branch name, upstream status, staged changes, etc.).\n* **Themes:** The script supports different themes for the prompt, offering various color combinations.\n* **Virtual environments:** It can integrate virtual environment information into the prompt.\n* **Automatic updates:** The script automatically updates the prompt whenever you switch Git branches or modify the repository.\n\n**Why you would use it:**\n\n* **Enhanced workflow:** Knowing the current Git branch, status, and potential conflicts directly in your prompt makes it easier to navigate your projects and understand the state of your codebase.\n* **Increased productivity:** Quick access to Git information can save you time by avoiding unnecessary commands and navigating repositories more efficiently.\n* **Improved readability:** The customizable nature of the script allows you to tailor the prompt to your preferences and enhance its readability.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n* **Branch information:**  Displays the current branch name or detached HEAD state.\n* **Upstream status:** Shows how your local branch compares to its upstream.\n* **Change status:** Indicates staged, unstaged, conflicted, untracked, and stashed changes.\n* **Virtual environment:** Shows the active virtual environment if you're using one.\n* **User customization:** Allows you to define colors, symbols, and prompt structure to your liking.\n\n**How to use it:**\n\n1. **Save the script:** Copy the script contents into a file (e.g., `git-prompt.sh`).\n2. **Make it executable:** Run `chmod +x git-prompt.sh`.\n3. **Source the script:** Add `source /path/to/git-prompt.sh` to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`).\n4. **Configure settings:** Modify the script's variables to adjust the prompt's appearance and behavior (see comments within the script).\n\n**Note:**  This script assumes you have Git installed and configured on your system. \n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about prompting in depth:\n\n* Check out the whitepaper issued with today's content,\n* Try out the apps listed at the top of this notebook ([TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/), [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) and [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)),\n* Read the [Introduction to Prompting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro) from the Gemini API docs,\n* Explore the Gemini API's [prompt gallery](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/prompts) and try them out in AI Studio,\n* Check out the Gemini API cookbook for [inspirational examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/) and [educational quickstarts](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/).\n\nAnd please share anything exciting you have tried in the Discord!","metadata":{"id":"2a8266d97ce5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
